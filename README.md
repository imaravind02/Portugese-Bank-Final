# Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis & Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset** and building machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

The goal is to extract business insights and build predictive models that help banks improve their marketing strategies and customer targeting.
